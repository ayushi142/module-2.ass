			<span id='nr2'>Freedom from and for</span>
			    <p>"freedom from"-which is a freedomthat comes from breaking out of 'Psychological slavery' imposed by outside forces such
			    	as parents,society,or religion.

			<span id='nr3'>Epilogue</span>
			    <p>True freedom is spiritual it has nothing to do with the outside world.It is not political,not economic.It has something to do with your innermost being,which cannot be chained or put into jail.it is that you are free from the past,that you are
			    free from the future.</p>
